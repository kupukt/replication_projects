Here from this stock data, we can see that WDAY has the highest closing prices throughout the past 5 years and no one has overcome them on the closing price. When looking at the volume of people buying the stocks, WDAY is near the bottom in the single digits in the millions, F on the other hand has the highest volume of stocks bought, all around the same time that WDAY has the highest amount of closing prices. We can propose that if people want to make the most money out of WDAY, they should buy stocks around the same time that F has the most stocks being bought up.
